  <LoadingScreenTip>You will not get paid for delivering cargo if any of the cargo goes missing or gets damaged during the transport.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Generating more power than the devices in the submarine are consuming may damage junction boxes or cause fires.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Junction boxes and other electrical devices may get damaged if they stay submerged too long.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.</LoadingScreenTip>

  <LoadingScreenTip>Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.</LoadingScreenTip>  
  <LoadingScreenTip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</LoadingScreenTip>

  <LoadingScreenTip>The cephalopod-like watchers are generally docile, but may attack when provoked.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Mantises can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp claws.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons unless hit from below.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.</LoadingScreenTip>
  
  <LoadingScreenTip>Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</LoadingScreenTip>
  
  <LoadingScreenTip>When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for - fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Be careful not to dive too deep. Most submarine hulls will start collapsing at the depth of approximately 2000 meters.</LoadingScreenTip>

  <LoadingScreenTip>The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and co-operation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.</LoadingScreenTip>
  <LoadingScreenTip>Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust - the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.</LoadingScreenTip>
